### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michelle, Im studying software engineering at the University of Auckland, graduating in July 2023!

Im a highly ambitious, quick learner with an extroverted personality. I love all things puzzle related! The tougher the problem the more rewarding it is to solve!

In my free time, I enjoy coding, homebrewing, and hiking, as well as participating in events such as the Wonder Project, which brings STEM education to local schools.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile app that collates all the TLDR news into one location
